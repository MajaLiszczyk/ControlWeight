# ControlWeight
Description: This application helps monitor body changes. In the main menu, the user can navigate to the 'about' section for a brief description of the application or go to their measurements. There, the user can add a new measurement, which includes: date, weight, hip circumference, waist circumference, thigh circumference, chest circumference, and arm circumference. The 'date' field automatically fills in with the current date, but the user can select a different date (if, for example, they forgot to make an entry the previous day). There is one condition - the user cannot choose a date that is already recorded in the measurement history. Measurement history - the user also has access to their measurement history, which is stored in the database. Each measurement can be deleted or edited by the user (except for the 'date' field). The application is very clear and intuitive to use.
